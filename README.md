# Cozy Survival
(working title)

## Themes:
**Survival:** Have you ever wanted to cook a meal for everyone, but everyone ate yesterday so no one is hungry? Survive is included to facilitate role play and community rather than to make the game difficult, but it still makes it harder, and thirst and cold can still kill you. Other mods like Healing Campfire are included to mitigate the harshness of the natural environment.

**Peaceful:** The main adversity is from natural elements, not from fighting monsters. You can still find them underground if and when you need to (Peaceful Surface), but you won't have to fight off hoards of monsters or generate a lot of light polution. You can go stargazing in peace.

**Exploration and Transportation:**
